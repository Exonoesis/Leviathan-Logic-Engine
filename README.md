---

### Project Description
The Leviathan Logic Engine is a content-focused game creation framework with ease of flow in mind. The union of this framework and third-party tools aspires to maintain focus on the game's vision, keeping specialties such as art, narrative, and audio creation at the forefront. 

> NOTE: This project is still in the early stages of development. This version of the engine is far from being considered complete, and there are no tools yet. Using the engine in its current state will require programming knowledge.
