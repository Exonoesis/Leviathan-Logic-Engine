# Leviathan Logic Engine

---

### Project Description
This engine is a cross-genre game making tool meant to be approachable for every type of game designer. If you want a truly programming free experience in order to focus on art, narrative, and audio components, then you've come to the right place. If you want a base engine to program your own unique mechanics on top of; still the right place. 

> NOTE: This project is still in the early stages of development. This version of the engine is far from being considered complete and there are no tools as of yet. Using the engine in its current state will require programming knowledge.

I made this logic engine to serve as the foundation for my own games (both free and commercial) with the idea that once the core logic was programmed the rest of the process would be done through user-friendly external tools using plain language in order to ease the creation process. Underpinning every decision in this project is the goal to reduce cognitive load and improve ease of flow for the designer.
